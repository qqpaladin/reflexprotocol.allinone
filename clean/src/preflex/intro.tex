\chapter{PREFLEX}
\label{chapter:preflex}
This chapter introduces PREFLEX, a new architecture for pooling resources -more particularly path diversity- that promotes cooperation between end hosts and edge network and attempts to draw benefits from Congestion Exposure (see 2.3). Section 3.1 presents Loss EXposure LEX, a congestion exposure protocol that end hosts uses to reveal experienced losses to the network. While in section 3.2, we are going to see Path RE-Feedback PREF the second components of the architecture, that edge network uses to inform the end host of its path preference. This path preference is based on  the split that the balancing algorithm described in section 3.3 chooses to optimize the global congestion experienced in the different paths.
